# Spotify Song Suggestor Application
Build Week November 16-20, 2020

This API created by Lambda Students uses an K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm that anaylzed
our numerical features, which include categories such as danceability, loudness, tempo, etc.
The K-NN Model then returned 10 songs that were within closest/similar vector space to the 
original song chosen by the user.


## Endpoint

Our organization(TT-69) deployed a Heroku App that can be found 
[here](https://predictifyforspotify.herokuapp.com/).


## Data

The K-Nearest Neighbors model was trained on data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks).
