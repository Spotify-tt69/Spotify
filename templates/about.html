    <h3>Given a Challenge of predicting a Spotify Playlist that tunes to a users mood/song choice/genre a team of Data Science Students
        from Lambda came together and made Predictify.  This App allows you the user to choose a piece of criteria and in return you will
        recieve a playlist suited to your liking.  We love feedback and would love to hear what you think of the App.
